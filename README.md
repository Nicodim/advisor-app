# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\    
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test:unit`
I changed the configuration a bit now the tests are run by the command npm run test:unit

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run dev`
I have changed the settings in package.json, so it can now run. 
The server should now start up along with the client side of the application. 
If you want to run the server and client separately, you can still use 'npm start' and 'node server.js' in the server folder
